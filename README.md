# Google Trends with other Time Series Data using Pandas & Matplotlib of Python

ðŸŒŸWhat can the popularity of search terms tell us about the world? Google Trends gives us access to the popularity of Google Search terms. Let's investigate:

ðŸ‘‰How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin

ðŸ‘‰How search volume for a hot stock like Telsa relates to that stock's price and

ðŸ‘‰How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States

ðŸŒŸWe can answer all these questions using methods like:

âœ…Use .describe() to quickly see some descriptive statistics at a glance.

âœ…Use .resample() to make a time-series data comparable to another by changing the periodicity.

âœ…Work with matplotlib.dates Locators to better style a timeline (e.g., an axis on a chart).

âœ…Find the number of NaN values with .isna().values.sum()

âœ…Change the resolution of a chart using the figure's dpi

âœ…Create dashed '--' and dotted '-.' lines using linestyles

âœ…Use different kinds of markers (e.g., 'o' or '^') on charts.

âœ…Fine-tuning the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linewidth and colours (both in the form of named colours and HEX codes).

âœ…Using .grid() to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.

ðŸŒŸIn this way we have obtained the conclusions of the various Google Search Trends v/s Respective Problem Statement.
